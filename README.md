*Cucumber is a free and open source behavior-driven development (BDD) tool that supports the development process. Its ordinary language parser, Gherkin, allows software behavior to be specified in a logical language that anyone can understand. Perform Appium automation tests on [TestMu AI's online cloud](https://www.testmuai.com/appium-mobile-testing).*

## Pre-requisites

Before you can start performing Ruby automation testing with Selenium, you would need to:

- Install **Ruby** and **gem** on your local system. Follow these instructions to install on different operating systems.

  - For **Windows**, you can download from the [official website](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/).
  - For **Linux** or **Ubuntu**, you can run a simple apt command like below:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install ruby-full
    ```

  - For **macOS**, you can run a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) command like this:

    ```bash
    brew install ruby
    ```

- Ensure you have Dependency manager **bundler** installed. If not installed, you can install with the following command -

  ```
  gem install bundler
  ```

### Clone The Sample Project

Clone the TestMu AI’s [LT_Ruby_Appium](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-ruby-cucumber) and navigate to the code directory as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-ruby-cucumber
cd LT-appium-ruby-cucumber
```

### Setting Up Your Authentication

Make sure you have your TestMu AI credentials with you to run test automation scripts on LambdaTest. To obtain your access credentials, [purchase a plan](https://billing.lambdatest.com/billing/plans) or access the [Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/).

Set TestMu AI `Username` and `Access Key` in environment variables.

**For Linux/macOS:**

```js
export LT_USERNAME=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME \
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY
```
  
**For Windows:**

```js
set LT_USERNAME=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME `
set LT_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY
```
  
### Upload Your Application

Upload your **_iOS_** application (.ipa file) or **_android_** application (.apk file) to the TestMu AI servers using our **REST API**. You need to provide your **Username** and **AccessKey** in the format `Username:AccessKey` in the **cURL** command for authentication. Make sure to add the path of the **appFile** in the cURL request. Here is an example cURL request to upload your app using our REST API:

**Using App File:**

**For Linux/macOS:**

```js
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" \
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \
--form 'name="Android_App"' \
--form 'appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk"' 
```

**For Windows;**

```js
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk""
```

**Using App URL:**

**For Linux/macOS:**

```js
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" \
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \
--form 'name="Android_App"' \
--form 'url="https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk"'
```

**For Windows:**

```js
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -d "{"url":"https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk","name":"sample.apk"}"
```

**Tip:**

- If you do not have any **.apk** or **.ipa** file, you can run your sample tests on TestMu AI by using our sample :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa).
- Response of above cURL will be a **JSON** object containing the `App URL` of the format - <lt://APP123456789123456789> and will be used in the next step.

## Run Your First Test

**Test Scenario:** Check out [first_steps.rb](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-ruby-cucumber/blob/master/Android/examples/First_test/features/step_definitions/first_steps.rb) file to view the sample test script in android/ios folder and [first.config.yml](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-ruby-cucumber/blob/master/iOS/examples/First_test/features/step_definitions/first_steps.rb) to make changes to the username, accessKey and app url.

### Configuring Your Test Capabilities

You can update your custom capabilities in test scripts. In this sample project, we are passing platform name, platform version, device name and app url (generated earlier) along with other capabilities like build name and test name via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the sample code are defined as:

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="android-config" label="Android" default>

```ruby title="Android first.config.yml)"
server: "mobile-hub.lambdatest.com"
user: "LT_USERNAME"    # Add Lambdatest username here
key: "LT_ACCESS_KEY"   # Add Lambdtest accessKey here


common_caps:

  "build": "br-1"
  

browser_caps:
  -
    "isRealMobile": "true"
    "platform": "android"
    "deviceName": "Galaxy S21 5G"
    "platformVersion": "11"
    "app": "APP_URL"      # Add your app url here
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ios-config" label="iOS" default>

```ruby title="iOS first.config.yml"
server: "mobile-hub.lambdatest.com"
user: "LT_USERNAME"    # Add Lambdatest username here
key: "LT_ACCESS_KEY"   # Add Lambdtest accessKey here

common_caps:

  "build": "br-2"
  

browser_caps:
  -
    "isRealMobile": "true"
    "platform": "ios"
    "deviceName": "iPad (2017)"
    "platformVersion": "13"
    "app": "APP_URL"      # Add your app url here
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

**Info Note:**

- You must add the generated **APP_URL** to the `"app"` capability in the config file.
- You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt **[Capabilities Generator tool](https://www.testmuai.com/capabilities-generator/beta/index.html)**. A more Detailed Capability Guide is available [here](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/desired-capabilities-in-appium/).

## Executing The Tests

- Switch to `run_first_test` directory under [Android examples](android/examples) or [iOS examples](ios/examples)

- Go to `config/first.config.yml` and edit the username, acessKey and add your app url.

- Run the following commands to run your tests

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec rake first
```

### **Speed up test execution with parallel testing :**

- Switch to `run_parallel_test` directory under [Android examples](android/examples/) or [iOS examples](ios/examples/)


### **Use Local testing for apps that access resources hosted in development or testing environments :**

- Switch to `run_local_test` directory under [Android examples](android/examples/) or [iOS examples](ios/examples/)

**Info:** Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the :link: [TestMu AI App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build).
