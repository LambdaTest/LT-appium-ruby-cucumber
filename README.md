# How to install apps in Real Devices using Custom App ID on [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-ruby-cucumber-customName) using the Cucumber Framework With Appium (Ruby)

While performing app automation testing with Appium on LambdaTest Grid, you might face a scenario where the APP ID generated by you is lost/confusing since it looks something like this - ```lt://APP12430338390303038292```.
You can easily change this to something readable like this - ```Proverbial Android v1.56```.
Let's quickly learn how to achieve this.
### Setting Up Your Authentication

Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts on LambdaTest. To obtain your access credentials, [purchase a plan](https://billing.lambdatest.com/billing/plans) or access the [Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/).

Set LambdaTest `Username` and `Access Key` in environment variables.

**For Linux/macOS:**

```js
export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME" \
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```
  
**For Windows:**

```js
set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME" `
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```
 
### Upload Your Application

Upload your **_iOS_** application (.ipa file) or **_android_** application (.apk file) to the LambdaTest servers using our **REST API**. You need to provide your **Username** and **AccessKey** in the format `Username:AccessKey` in the **cURL** command for authentication. Make sure to add the path of the **appFile** in the cURL request. Here is an example cURL request to upload your app using our REST API:

**Using App File:**

**Linux/macOS:**

```js
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" \
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \
--form 'name="Android_App"' \
--form 'appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk"' \
--form 'custom_id="ENTER_CUSTOM_ID_HERE"'
```

**Windows:**

```js
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "appFile=@"C:\Users\varunkumarb\Downloads\proverbial_android.apk"" -F "custom_id=ENTER_CUSTOM_ID_HERE"
```

**Using App URL:**

**Linux/macOS:**

```js
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" \
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \
--form 'name="Android_App"' \
--form 'url="https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk"' \
--form 'custom_id="ENTER_CUSTOM_ID_HERE"'
```

**For Windows:**

```js
curl --location --request POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --data-urlencode "url=https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk" --data-urlencode "name=teest" --data-urlencode "custom_id=ENTER_CUSTOM_ID_HERE"
```

**Example using a Custom App ID**

```js
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" \
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \
--form 'name="Android_App"' \
--form 'url="https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk"' \
--form 'custom_id="Proverbial Android v1.56"'
```

**Tip:**

- If you do not have any **.apk** or **.ipa** file, you can run your sample tests on LambdaTest by using our sample :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa).
- Response of above cURL will be a **JSON** object containing the `App URL` of the format - <lt://APP123456789123456789> and will be used in the next step.
- Alternatively you can also use the `Custom ID` that you defined in your own words.

## Run Your First Test

Once you are done with the above-mentioned steps, you can initiate your first Ruby test on LambdaTest.

### Configuring Your Test Capabilities

You can update your custom capabilities in test scripts. In this sample project, we are passing platform name, platform version, device name and app url (generated earlier) along with other capabilities like build name and test name via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the sample code are defined as:

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="ios-config" label="iOS" default>

```
server: "mobile-hub.lambdatest.com"

common_caps:
  "user": "username"
  "accessKey": "accesskey"
  "project": "First Cucumber Android Project"
  "build": "build-1"
  

browser_caps:
  -
    "platformName": "Android"
    "platformVersion": "9"
    "deviceName": "Galaxy S8 Plus"


    #Enter the Custom_ID here that was used to upload your application

    "app": "ENTER_CUSTOM_ID_HERE"
    
    "name": "first_test"
    "isRealMobile": "true"
```

## Executing The Tests

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="ios" label="iOS" default>

If you are using an **iOS** app, the cURL command will generate an app URL for the corresponding iOS app and install the same for running the tests. You can either use our sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa) or upload your own app as discussed earlier.

Navigate to the corresponding directory based on your app.

```bash
cd ios
```
Execute the following command to run your test on LambdaTest platform:

```bash
bundle exec rake first
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the [LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build).
